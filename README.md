### Is Maestro actively maintained?

I am actively involved in Maestro's development, and have used the patterns contained in it since I started roku development. These are the most productive and maintainable patterns and tools I've found so far, and I will continue to use them for my clients. The patterns that are used in maestro are further explorations and rewrites of similar patterns I have used in apps that have millions of installs, with extremely low crash %'s
